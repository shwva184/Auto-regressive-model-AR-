# Auto-regressive-model-AR-

Building autoregressive models for a data set corresponding to the Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL) over the past few decades. The data is taken from https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/sea-level/.
 Steps performed :
  1) Detrending the data , and spliting into training and validation data.
  2) Function to fit AR(p) model.
  3) Function for 1step prediction.
  4) Model validation and order selection
  5) Long range prediction , simulating AR(p) model to predict m steps into future.
  6) NAR( ) model with a feedforward (MLP) network
